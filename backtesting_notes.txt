- Use walk-forward validation for realistic performance estimates.
- Avoid lookahead bias: ensure features are created only from information available at prediction time.
- For trading strategy simulation, convert predictions into signals (e.g., long if predicted next-day return > threshold) and compute P&L, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown.
- Include transaction costs and slippage assumptions.
